# About
This repository [[2]](#References) contains the MATLAB code associated with [[1]](#References), where an integrated design is followed for the combined problem of acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and noise reduction (NR) in a general multi-microphone/multi-loudspeaker setup, with possibly linearly dependent miphone and loudspeaker signals. 

This repository provides example codes for the following resulting algorithms:
* MWF: Multi-channel Wiener filter;
* MWF<sub>ext</sub>: Extended multi-channel Wiener filter;
* AEC-NR: AEC preceding NR;
* NR-AEC: NR preceding AEC;
* NR<sub>ext</sub>-AEC-PF: Extended noise reduction (NR<sub>ext</sub>) preceding AEC and post-filter (PF).

The code has been developed and tested in MATLAB R2024a.
